I'll create a comprehensive Python implementation of a Personalized Noise Optimizer that analyzes ambient sound and generates adaptive background noise for focus and sleep.I've created a comprehensive Personalized Noise Optimizer that implements all the features you requested! Here's what the system includes:

## Key Features

**ðŸŽ§ Real-time Ambient Analysis**
- Analyzes microphone input for noise levels, frequency content, and environment type
- Classifies environments (quiet, office, traffic, nature, music)
- Tracks spectral characteristics and dominant frequencies

**ðŸ§  AI-Powered Adaptation**
- Uses machine learning (K-means clustering) to adapt to changing conditions
- Maintains user profiles with learned preferences
- Simulated EEG integration (easily replaceable with real EEG hardware)

**ðŸŽµ Multiple Noise Types**
- **White Noise**: Equal energy across all frequencies
- **Pink Noise**: 1/f noise, great for focus and masking
- **Brown Noise**: Deeper, more consistent for sleep
- **Nature Sounds**: Synthesized wind and ambient sounds
- **Binaural Beats**: For brainwave entrainment (focus/sleep)

**ðŸ”„ Three Operating Modes**
1. **Focus Mode**: Optimized for concentration with binaural beats
2. **Sleep Mode**: Gentle, consistent noise for relaxation
3. **Adaptive Mode**: AI automatically selects optimal noise type

## Installation Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy scipy pyaudio librosa scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How It Works

1. **Ambient Analysis**: Continuously monitors your environment through the microphone
2. **Intelligent Selection**: AI determines the best noise type based on current conditions
3. **Real-time Generation**: Synthesizes optimal background noise in real-time
4. **Biofeedback Integration**: Adapts to simulated brainwave data (EEG interface ready)
5. **Learning System**: Builds a personal profile of your preferences over time

## Usage

Run the script and select your preferred mode. The system will:
- Start analyzing ambient sound
- Generate adaptive background noise through speakers/headphones
- Display real-time analysis of your environment
- Continuously optimize for your current state

The system is designed to be modular - you can easily integrate real EEG hardware by replacing the `EEGSimulator` class with actual EEG device interfaces.
