I'll create a comprehensive Python implementation of a Personalized Noise Optimizer that analyzes ambient sound and generates adaptive background noise for focus and sleep.I've created a comprehensive Personalized Noise Optimizer that implements all the features you requested! Here's what the system includes:

## Key Features

**ðŸŽ§ Real-time Ambient Analysis**
- Analyzes microphone input for noise levels, frequency content, and environment type
- Classifies environments (quiet, office, traffic, nature, music)
- Tracks spectral characteristics and dominant frequencies

**ðŸ§  AI-Powered Adaptation**
- Uses machine learning (K-means clustering) to adapt to changing conditions
- Maintains user profiles with learned preferences
- Simulated EEG integration (easily replaceable with real EEG hardware)

Perfect! I've fixed the main section and expanded the Noise Optimizer with **15 specialized modes**. Here's what's now available:

## ðŸŽµ 15 Specialized Modes

1. **FOCUS** - Deep Focus with binaural beats for concentration
2. **SLEEP** - Deep Sleep with low frequency for rest
3. **STUDY** - Study Mode with pink noise for learning
4. **MEDITATION** - Meditation with Tibetan bowls & nature sounds
5. **CREATIVE** - Creative Flow with dynamic ambient sounds
6. **ANXIETY** - Anxiety Relief with calming frequencies
7. **WORKOUT** - Workout with energizing rhythmic noise
8. **READING** - Reading with minimal distraction sounds
9. **CODING** - Coding with consistent background hum
10. **MEETING** - Meeting with subtle masking noise
11. **NAP** - Power Nap with quick rest optimization
12. **STORM** - Storm Sounds with rain and thunder
13. **CAFE** - Cafe Ambience with social background noise
14. **FOREST** - Forest Sounds with deep nature immersion
15. **ADAPTIVE** - AI Adaptive with smart mode switching

## ðŸŽ§ New Sound Types Added

- **Tibetan Bowls** - Harmonic singing bowl sounds for meditation
- **Rain Sounds** - Realistic rain with droplet effects
- **Thunder** - Full storm experience with rumbles
- **Ocean Waves** - Natural wave rhythms
- **Fire Crackling** - Cozy fireplace sounds with pops
- **Wind** - Natural wind gusts and breezes
- **Cafe Ambience** - Coffee shop chatter and clinks
- **Rhythmic Noise** - Energizing workout beats
- **Harmonic Series** - Mathematical harmony for focus
- **Pulse Waves** - Structured pulse patterns

## ðŸ§  Intelligent Mode Selection

Each mode now has its own smart selection strategy that considers:
- **Ambient noise levels**
- **Frequency content**
- **Environment type**
- **Time-specific optimization**

For example:
- **Focus Mode** switches between binaural beats, brown noise, or harmonic series based on your environment
- **Sleep Mode** adapts between gentle rain, ocean waves, or deep brown noise
- **Anxiety Mode** automatically selects the most calming option based on detected stress indicators

The system is now much more sophisticated and provides specialized optimization for every activity and mental state!

## Installation Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy scipy pyaudio librosa scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How It Works

1. **Ambient Analysis**: Continuously monitors your environment through the microphone
2. **Intelligent Selection**: AI determines the best noise type based on current conditions
3. **Real-time Generation**: Synthesizes optimal background noise in real-time
4. **Biofeedback Integration**: Adapts to simulated brainwave data (EEG interface ready)
5. **Learning System**: Builds a personal profile of your preferences over time

## Usage

Run the script and select your preferred mode. The system will:
- Start analyzing ambient sound
- Generate adaptive background noise through speakers/headphones
- Display real-time analysis of your environment
- Continuously optimize for your current state

The system is designed to be modular - you can easily integrate real EEG hardware by replacing the `EEGSimulator` class with actual EEG device interfaces.
